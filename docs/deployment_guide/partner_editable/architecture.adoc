.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS

NOTE: *Five IP addresses in each VPC subnet CIDR block are reserved and unavailable for use. For additional information, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html#subnet-basics[AWS documentation].

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
* A configurable number of private subnets with dedicated custom network access control lists (ACLs) per Availability Zone.
* Domain Name System (DNS) resolution in the VPC.
* A VPC gateway endpoint for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), which provide a secure, reliable connection to Amazon S3 without requiring an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or virtual private gateway.
** This uses the default endpoint policy, which gives any user or service within the VPC full access to Amazon S3 resources.
   This policy supplements any IAM user policies or S3 bucket policies that you may have in place.
** With these endpoints, you can access S3 resources from within the VPC created by the Quick Start.
   These endpoints are valid only for the AWS Region in which you launch the Quick Start.
** For more information about VPC endpoints, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-s3.html[AWS documentation].

NOTE: Default subnet sizes are based on a typical deployment but can be reconfigured, as discussed in the link:#_predeployment_steps[Predeployment steps] section.
